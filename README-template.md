## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css

/* border-radius in % works as an oval but use with px works as a circle, gives equal borders. */
```

### Continued development

I have kind of trouble at centering the pictures above the backgroud in order to put them exactly where they are in the challenge photos.
